biblically accurate xeyes
-------------------------

At last, comprehensive Cyrillic support for xeyes(1).

![(An array of ten eyes in a box labelled 'Cyrillic letter Multiocular O'. A mouse pointer moves past them and the eyes follow.)](x10.gif)

Invoke as 

    xeyes -multiocular 7      (Unicode pre-15)

or

    xeyes -multiocular 10     (Unicode 15.0 or later)

(Or you can configure with an X resource, if that's your kink.)

You don't even need to tussle with `Imake` to build this
(eyeronically).

Original README follows:
